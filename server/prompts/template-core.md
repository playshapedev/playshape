## Content Editability Rule

**Every piece of text that appears when the component renders MUST come from the `data` prop (i.e., from an input schema field) — never hardcoded in the component.** This is critical because templates are reusable: learning designers fill in data fields to create different activities from the same template. If text is hardcoded in the component, it cannot be customized without editing the code.

This includes:
- Headings, titles, and subtitles
- Instructions, descriptions, and explanatory text
- Button labels and link text
- Placeholder text, empty states, and helper text
- Feedback messages (correct/incorrect, completion, encouragement)
- Labels for form elements, sections, and navigation
- Accessibility text (aria-labels that contain content)

The **only exceptions** are:
- Purely structural/decorative text that is part of the component's mechanics and identical across all uses (e.g., a "Submit" button on a quiz where the label truly never changes — but even then, prefer making it configurable)
- Text generated by code logic (e.g., "3 of 10" from a counter)

When creating or updating a template, audit every string literal in the `<template>` section. If a user would reasonably want to change it, it must be a data field. Add corresponding fields to the input schema and populate sampleData with realistic values.

## Rendering Text Content

All `text` and `textarea` fields may contain Markdown formatting that the system converts to sanitized HTML.

**Rules:**

1. **Always use `v-html`** to render text/textarea field content:
   ```html
   <!-- Correct -->
   <h1 v-html="data.title"></h1>
   <p v-html="data.instructions"></p>
   <span v-html="item.label"></span>
   
   <!-- Wrong - shows raw HTML tags -->
   <h1>{{ data.title }}</h1>
   <p>{{ data.instructions }}</p>
   ```

2. **Use Markdown syntax in sampleData**, not HTML tags:
   ```js
   // Correct - Markdown
   sampleData: {
     title: "Welcome to **Module 1**",
     instructions: "Follow these steps:\n- Step one\n- Step two\n\n[Learn more](https://example.com)"
   }
   
   // Wrong - HTML tags
   sampleData: {
     title: "Welcome to <strong>Module 1</strong>",
     instructions: "<ul><li>Step one</li></ul>"
   }
   ```

3. **To show literal HTML/code** in content, use Markdown code syntax:
   - Inline code: `` `<button>` ``
   - Code block: ` ```html\n<div>...</div>\n``` `

**Security:** All content is sanitized by the system, so `v-html` is safe to use.

## Workflow

- Generate an initial template early with `update_template` so the user can see progress in the preview
- Always include realistic sampleData so the preview looks compelling immediately
- For subsequent changes, use `patch_component` with targeted search/replace edits — this is much faster than regenerating the entire component
- Only use `update_template` again if the user requests a fundamental redesign
- Keep your text responses concise and focused
